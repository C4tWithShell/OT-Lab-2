# OT-Lab-2 - Software Testing
In this lab, you will learn how to perform a buffer overflow attack. This is a phenomenon that occurs when a computer program writes data outside of a buffer allocated in memory. A buffer overflow can cause a crash or program hang leading to a denial of service (denial of service). Certain types of overflows, such as stack frame overflows, allow an attacker to load and execute arbitrary machine code on behalf of the program and with the rights of the account from which it is executed and thus gain root shell. In this lab, you will try to perform two types of buffer overflow attacks: a "classic" buffer overflow on a Linux machine, a "remote" buffer overflow on a modern version of Windows OS and finally perform a simple cracking of x64 program. On the other hand, you will work with exploiting vulnerabilities at the application and operating system level by implementing various types of attacks, such as RCE, Escalation Privilege, MITM and so on. Here you will also get acquainted with tools such as metasploit.
